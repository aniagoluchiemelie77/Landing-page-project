                        Diamaka is a fast, professional and skilled content strategist. Her work pulled the trigger and helped us triple our leads, subscription and sales in less than three months. She created 30 topic clusters for us, and all the topics were answers to our audiences' questions. Our-in-house writers loved her content outlines because they contained the reader's buying stage, what they knew about the topic and what they wanted to learn. It was so detailed that it shortened their research and turnover time. We've only written 11 topics and love the result we see, I recommend her to start-ups that want to quickly build content authority in the see of content on the internet.
